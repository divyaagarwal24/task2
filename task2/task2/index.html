    <h3 id="about">About</h3>
    <p id="tribute-info"></p> Mohit Sharma was posted to Kashmir where he displayed his bravery
     and dedication for the country. During his time in Kashmir, in 2004, Mohit was given 
     the mission to infiltrate the group of Hizbul Mujahideen and get some crucial intel
      about their operations and plans. He successfully established contact with two terrorists
       of the Islamic group under the name Iftikhar Bhatt. Mohit grew his beard and hair long 
       to fit the stereotypical look of a terrorist to make it easier for him to blend in the group.</e></b>
